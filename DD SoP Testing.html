        <p>The purpose of this process is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuously monitor the end-user experience to detect website performance issues.</li>
            <li>Find and fix web performance issues in both internal and customer-facing applications before users are affected.</li>
            <li>Check if web servers or applications are up, down, or experiencing high loads.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="mcetoc_1i2cjk40ln">II. SCOPE</h2>
        <p>This process applies to all members of the Command Center.</p>
        <h2 id="mcetoc_1i2cjk40lo">III. PROCESS</h2>
        <p>This process applies to Provider, Avalere, ComplexCare Solutions, Pharmacy and Payer Synthetic Monitors recorded in Datadog that simulate real user activity on a website. The automated user activity such as logging into the site or selecting various links on the page are played at various intervals from various locations to detect website performance issues. The steps to manually validate the websites are documented in this SOP.</p>
