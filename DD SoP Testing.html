        <p>The purpose of this process is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuously monitor the end-user experience to detect website performance issues.</li>
            <li>Find and fix web performance issues in both internal and customer-facing applications before users are affected.</li>
            <li>Check if web servers or applications are up, down, or experiencing high loads.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="mcetoc_1i2cjk40ln">II. SCOPE</h2>
        <p>This process applies to all members of the Command Center.</p>
        <h2 id="mcetoc_1i2cjk40lo">III. PROCESS</h2>
        <p>This process applies to Provider, Avalere, ComplexCare Solutions, Pharmacy and Payer Synthetic Monitors recorded in Datadog that simulate real user activity on a website. The automated user activity such as logging into the site or selecting various links on the page are played at various intervals from various locations to detect website performance issues. The steps to manually validate the websites are documented in this SOP.</p>

Be sure to escalate these at 21 and 7 Days to expiry. An alert will be received at 21 days; monitor the CC Dashboard to determine Day 7 See <a href="#mcetoc_placeholder2">entry #1</a> in the SYNTHETIC MONITOR INFORMATION CHART for further details on SSL escalations.</li>

            <li>Check the Synthetic Monitor to determine which step is failing. (See Information Chart below)</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>When an alert is received, manually perform the Synthetic TX steps to validate the website status prior to escalating. (See Information Chart below).</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>If manual validation returns the web page as expected, without error, and the referenced text/image can be verified, no escalation is required. Notify CC ONLY of the results. <b style="text-decoration: underline">However, if the Monitor does not recover in 5-10 mins, and you have ruled out a possible pw change to account, do an fyi escalation.</b></li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>If manual validation does NOT return the web page as expected, has an error, or the referenced text/image cannot be verified, follow the escalation instructions in the SOP for each TX & API and provide the error(s) received and screenshot(s). <b style="text-decoration: underline">When escalating, if a response is not received via email, reach out via teams or phone to those listed in the TO section first, then the CC section.</b></li>
            &nbsp;
